//There are many In-Built functions in JS,example:
console.log(); Math.pow(); Math.sqrt(); etc.
/* These in-built functions work without us writing any code for it.
The reason why they work? -->
Due to 'abstraction', a term given to the functions which are encoded and do not require the user to code the 
for the same function any line of codes, and thus can call onto these functions at their own disposal.

//In software engineering and programming language theory, the abstraction principle is a basic dictum that aims to reduce duplication of information in a program whenever practical by making use of abstractions provided by the programming language or software libraries.
//Abstraction is part of OOP.
